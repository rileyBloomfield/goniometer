**Searching:** Two sensors will be found. If the application cannot connect to two sensors, this will search indefinitely.

**Connecting:** The first two sensors discovered will be connected. There is currently no option to distinguish between discovered sensors.

**Configurations:** If the sensors have been used previously with an alternative application, the sensor configurations may be reset. This process will happen automatically if required but may increase connection time to a few minutes.

**Flexion:** The flexion angle of the instrumetned limb is shown in degrees on the live display.

**Tare:** Pressing the tare button is used to apply an offset to all future readings streamed from the sensors. The result of applying this offset brings the current tare position to a zeroed location.

**Reset Tare:** The previously set tare orientations obtained will be reset, showing flexion angles computed from the sensor default readings.

**Connecting:** Exit to the previous [connecting sensors](#connecting-sensors) screen to reset the current connection and rediscover sensors for connection.
